This project creates a file sharing site in PHP and HTML that supports uploading, viewing, and deleting files associated with various users. New users can also create private accounts. 

Creative Portion:
	1.	Drag-and-Drop File Upload: Users can easily upload files by dragging and dropping them into the designated area.
	2.	File Preview for Images and PDFs: Uploaded image and PDF files can be previewed directly before finalizing the upload.
	3.	User ID Creation: Users can generate a unique ID, ensuring that duplicate IDs are not allowed.

 You can use the following user IDs to test: Alice, Wilson, Bob, and Charlie. But feel free to create new users.
